### The COVID-19 Mobility Data Network

It is important to recognize that the aggregated mobility metrics now available through a surge of publicly available dashboards are just one source of information about behavioral responses to interventions, and to consider their limitations. Different data sources will produce mobility estimates that reflect the demographic and geographic coverage of the owners of devices they come from. We expect these to be biased, both across different geographies and among different demographic groups, and must therefore be interpreted in their particular social, economic and political context. The inability of communities to physically distance, for example, is most often a reflection of underlying economic realities that preclude working from home or not working at all, and warrants supportive measures that allow people to physically distance, to the extent feasible. For denser populations in the global south, physical distancing may not be an option. 
 
Such analysis would greatly benefit from the several years of epidemiological research conducted using mobility data. The Network makes available trained scientists to serve as trusted intermediaries between the aggregated data received from technology companies and the policy makers and communities that seek to use them.
