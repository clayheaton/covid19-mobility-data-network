In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, technology companies and mobile phone operators are coming forward to provide important, epidemiologically-relevant data from mobile devices, that could help to inform policies that reduce the spread of the virus. For example, aggregated location data from mobile phones can be used to provide important population-level information about how people are moving around. Given that social distancing interventions — including travel restrictions, working from home, closing schools, universities, and non-essential retail and restaurant venues, and canceling social gatherings — are important interventions available to slow transmission in the early stage of the epidemic, monitoring how well public messaging is working will be key to its successful implementation. Measuring the impact of social distancing interventions on movement patterns, and subsequently on the spread of COVID-19, will therefore be an essential prerequisite to generate evidence for when we relax restrictions to resume our lives and livelihoods while managing the risk of resurgence.
