The participants in the COVID19 Mobility Data Network share a deep commitment to privacy values and data protection as well as best practice principles related to data governance and ethics. The following principles guide the Network’s effort:
 
1. The use of data, including data sharing, aggregation, and analysis, for Covid19 response must speak to a clear need articulated by public health authorities, and for no other purpose.
1. The use of data must both be in compliance with existing laws and adhere to best practice principles of data governance.
1. Data should be aggregated to the lowest feasible resolution possible while maintaining its desired utility.
1. The use of data must be transparent, inclusive, and safeguarded against unintended consequences.
 
The Network itself will not be the recipient of data. The use of data facilitated by the Network will be subject to the various approval and oversight mechanisms provided by the academic home institutions of the individual researchers participating in the Network. The Network facilitates the sharing of consolidated daily situation reports with government health officials and provides analytic support. It does not share the underlying data sets with governments, third parties, or the public at large. Participants in the Network embrace appropriate legal, organizational, and computational safeguards to minimize - and carefully manage any remaining - data privacy risks associated with this research effort in general and the use of aggregated data in particular.
