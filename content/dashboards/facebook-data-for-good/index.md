The information provided by Facebook on population mobility always needs to be contextualized with a range of additional data sources on local demographics, infrastructure and socioeconomic indicators, in order to understand the underlying reasons for the observed variations in mobility, and how they may impact the risks associated with COVID-19.

There are many reasons why some areas may demonstrate greater relative reduction in mobility than others. Areas with higher densities of population and infrastructure, including grocery stores and pharmacies, tend to be characterized by shorter trips and easier access to essential services. Areas with lower densities of population and infrastructure tend to demonstrate higher mobility at baseline simply based upon the need to travel for access to jobs and services. Finally, these data represent a slice of Facebook users with location services enabled, and may therefore be overrepresented in certain populations and underrepresented in others.

## Population Mobility Data and Physical Distancing Efforts Related to Stopping the Spread of COVID-19

In the absence of a vaccine or an effective treatment, communities throughout the world have relied upon “non-pharmaceutical interventions” (NPIs) such as physical distancing to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus and reduce the impact of acute cases on medical systems. By reducing their rates of mobility and avoiding large gatherings, people are reducing the likelihood that the virus is transmitted from person to person, and that large numbers of acute cases that require intensive care overburden hospitals. 

When policymakers from the federal to the city level began instituting physical distancing measures ranging from school and restaurant closures to stay-at-home orders one of the most important pieces of information they required was evidence that rates of mobility were in fact decreasing, and that rates of distancing were likely increasing. Aggregated and anonymized data from Facebook, based on users who have opted in to enable location services on the Facebook app, which shows rates at which people have been moving around or staying put near their homes, has been vital to providing guidance on how distancing efforts are being followed and where communities may require additional messaging and support to enable them to stay home and stay safe.  

The data contained in this map displays at the county level changes in the rates of mobility and staying put which can enable not only policy makers but individuals and communities as well to understand the degree to which their areas may be adhering to physical distancing efforts. Variations in mobility rates, displayed in time series on the graphs, are measured against a baseline from the end of February in order to understand how different the current situation is compared to the mobility patterns observed prior to distancing orders being issued. These should not be interpreted as absolute numbers of people avoiding public spaces or large gatherings, but relative rates at which people chose to reduce their mobility or remain near home.  

There are many different reasons why some areas may be demonstrating greater relative reduction than others. Areas with higher densities of population and infrastructure, including grocery stores and pharmacies, tend to be characterized by shorter trips and easier access to essential services. Areas with lower densities of population and infrastructure tend to demonstrate higher mobility at baseline simply based upon the need to travel for access to jobs and services. Other factors ranging from income to the mix of occupations in any area tend to have significant impacts upon the capacity of people to work from home or remain absent from jobs. Risk factors such as the proportion of people over the age of 65 are also significant to understand the potential relationships between rates of mobility and risks of acute complications from COVID-19.  Finally, these data represent a slice of Facebook users as earlier explained, and may therefore be overrepresented in certain populations and underrepresented in others.
