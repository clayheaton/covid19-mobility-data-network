### Code Repositories

Network members share code repositories, analytic tools and best practices via GitHub repositories and online community meeting spaces. 

### Mobility Data Metrics

This table includes a description of commonly used metrics to measure mobility, and will be useful to policy makers, media, and communities.

### Technical Guidance Document

We maintain a document that outlines

- considerations for public health use and privacy
- aggregation methods and sources of uncertainty
- methods for analysis of aggregated data and their purpose

### Comparison Analysis across Data Streams

This document provides information about how different sources of data compare to each other. In some cases, the metrics correlate well, but not all. We will be systematically making such comparisons across data as we progress, and providing information about comparability and uncertainty on our site. 

### Future Direction

As more data become available, Network researchers expect to assist the development of guidelines on how these metrics can inform the relaxation of restrictions, serological surveillance and community-based testing.
