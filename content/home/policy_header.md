**CMDN position on using mobility data to monitor protests**

In accordance with existing DUAs and the Data Use Policy of the Covid-19 Mobility Data Network, affiliated researchers will not share or analyze aggregated data to which they have access in order to monitor any aspect of human mobility other than physical distancing for the purpose of public health. Affiliated researchers will not work with any party requesting data or analysis which risks linking public health efforts to state surveillance. These same standards apply globally.
