title: "Facebook Data for Good Mobility Dashboard"
summary: "Movement range data helps us understand how communities are responding to COVID-19 physical distancing interventions in states and counties across the country. This anonymized, aggregated mobility data offers insights into how often people have been moving outside their home area or staying put since February 29, when interventions were first implemented."

_This map is based on insights developed by the Covid-19 Mobility Data Network, co-directed by [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org) and researchers from the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu), using aggregated data through [Facebook’s Data for Good program](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid19/)._

## Population Mobility Data and Physical Distancing Efforts Related to Stopping the Spread of COVID-19

In the absence of a vaccine or an effective treatment, communities throughout the world have relied upon “non-pharmaceutical interventions” (NPIs) such as physical distancing to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus and reduce the impact of acute cases on medical systems. By reducing their rates of mobility and avoiding large gatherings, people are reducing the likelihood that the virus is transmitted from person to person, and that large numbers of acute cases that require intensive care overburden hospitals.

When policymakers at all levels began instituting physical distancing measures ranging from school and restaurant closures to stay-at-home orders, one of the most important pieces of information they needed  was evidence that rates of mobility were in fact decreasing and that rates of distancing were increasing. Aggregated and privacy preserving  data from Facebook, which shows rates at which people have been moving around or generally staying put, has been vital to providing guidance on how distancing efforts are being followed and where communities may require additional messaging and support to enable them to stay home and stay safe.

The data contained in this map displays county level changes in the rates of mobility and staying put, which can allow people to understand the degree to which their communities  may be adopting physical distancing efforts. Variations in mobility rates, displayed in time series on the graphs, are measured against a baseline from the end of February. These should not be interpreted as absolute numbers of people avoiding public spaces or large gatherings, but relative rates at which people chose to reduce their mobility or remain near home.

The information provided by Facebook on population mobility always needs to be contextualized with a range of additional data sources on local demographics, infrastructure and socioeconomic indicators, in order to understand the underlying reasons for the observed variations in mobility, and how they may impact the risks associated with COVID-19. Researchers can access these additional insights through public data sources like census information, as well as through other commercially available statistics.

There are many reasons why some areas may demonstrate greater relative reduction in mobility than others. Areas with higher densities of population and infrastructure, including grocery stores and pharmacies, tend to be characterized by shorter trips and easier access to essential services. Areas with lower densities of population and infrastructure tend to demonstrate higher mobility before stay at home measures were put in place at baseline simply based upon the need to travel for access to jobs and services. Finally, these data represent a slice of Facebook users that have opted into the Location History setting, and may therefore be overrepresented in certain populations and underrepresented in others.
