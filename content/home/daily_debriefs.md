The response to COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated the extent of human mobility data available to technology companies, data aggregators and governments around the world. It is critical to proceed with caution - the misinterpretation of such data can result in misdirected policies; the misuse of such data can result in harm to individuals and groups. Network members adhere to the data use policy published on our website; only work with aggregated anonymized data analyzed at a temporal or spatial resolution that minimizes harm; and do not promote the use of data at a resolution that cannot be scientifically justified for the interventions proposed.

In accordance with existing DUAs and the data use policy of the Covid-19 Mobility Data Network, affiliated researchers will not share, nor will they analyze, aggregated data to which they have access in order to monitor any aspect of human mobility other than physical distancing for the purpose of public health. We feel it is important to be clear at this moment that affiliated researchers will not work with any party requesting data or analysis which threatens in any way to link public health efforts to state surveillance. These same standards apply globally.
