### Mobility Data

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, technology companies and mobile phone operators are coming forward to provide important, epidemiologically-relevant data from mobile devices, that could help to inform policies that reduce the spread of the virus. For example, aggregated location data from mobile phones can be used to provide important population-level information about how people are moving around. Given that social distancing interventions — including travel restrictions, working from home, closing schools, universities, and non-essential retail and restaurant venues, and canceling social gatherings — are important interventions available to slow transmission in the early stage of the epidemic, monitoring how well public messaging is working will be key to its successful implementation. Measuring the impact of social distancing interventions on movement patterns, and subsequently on the spread of COVID-19, will therefore be an essential prerequisite to generate evidence for when we relax restrictions to resume our lives and livelihoods while managing the risk of resurgence. 

Our position on the use of these data for combatting the Covid-19 pandemic is [articulated in this letter published in Science, on March 23rd, 2020](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/20/science.abb8021).

### The COVID-19 Mobility Data Network

It is important to recognize that the aggregated mobility metrics now available through a surge of publicly available dashboards are just one source of information about behavioral responses to interventions, and to consider their limitations. Different data sources will produce mobility estimates that reflect the demographic and geographic coverage of the owners of devices they come from. We expect these to be biased, both across different geographies and among different demographic groups, and must therefore be interpreted in their particular social, economic and political context. The inability of communities to physically distance, for example, is most often a reflection of underlying economic realities that preclude working from home or not working at all, and warrants supportive measures that allow people to physically distance, to the extent feasible. For denser populations in the global south, physical distancing may not be an option. 
 
Such analysis would greatly benefit from the several years of epidemiological research conducted using mobility data. The Network makes available trained scientists to serve as trusted intermediaries between the aggregated data received from technology companies and the policy makers and communities that seek to use them. 

### Resources

Despite several years of research in the use of mobility data for epidemiological modeling, standard frameworks for aggregating and making use of different data streams from mobile phones are lacking and difficult to generalize across data providers.  The Network provides openly shared resources for researchers interested in using these data to conduct work relevant for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak and the health impacts on populations around the world. 

### Daily Debriefs

Network researchers provide daily one-to-one debriefs to local departments of health and response agencies, so scientists may directly assist in interpreting the data and analysis.

The response to COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated the extent of human mobility data available to technology companies, data aggregators and governments around the world. It is critical to proceed with caution - the misinterpretation of such data can result in misdirected policies; the misuse of such data can result in harm to individuals and groups. Network members adhere to the data use policy published on our website; only work with aggregated anonymized data analyzed at a temporal or spatial resolution that minimizes harm; and do not promote the use of data at a resolution that cannot be scientifically justified for the interventions proposed.

### Technical Resources

1. **Code Repositories:** Network members share code repositories, analytic tools and best practices via GitHub repositories and online community meeting spaces. 
1. **Mobility Data Metrics:** This table includes a description of commonly used metrics to measure mobility, and will be useful to policy makers, media, and communities. _LINK GOES HERE_
1. **Mobility Data Technical Guidance Document that outlines:** 
    - considerations for public health use and privacy
    - aggregation methods and sources of uncertainty
    - methods for analysis of aggregated data and their purpose
    - _LINK GOES HERE_
1. **Comparison Analysis across data streams:** This document provides information about how different sources of data compare to each other. In some cases, the metrics correlate well, but not all. We will be systematically making such comparisons across data as we progress, and providing information about comparability and uncertainty on our site.

### Future direction

As more data become available, Network researchers expect to assist the development of guidelines on how these metrics can inform the relaxation of restrictions, serological surveillance and community-based testing. 

### Partnerships 

We are working in partnership with Facebook, Camber Systems, and Cuebiq, who provide our team with aggregated data sets in accordance with data use agreements and strict privacy-preserving policies. Through direct connections with departments of health at the city, state, and country-level, we provide situation reports to decision-makers who are implementing social distancing interventions. These data are critical in providing timely insights into the effectiveness of social distancing measures, for identifying potentially high-risk zones, and for planning the roll-back of restrictions.
